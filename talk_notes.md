## abstract

This talk reviews two years of work on energy_py - [a reinforcement learning for energy systems(https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/energy_py)].  We will look at lessons learned designing the library, experience using the library with Open AI gym and energy_py environments.  Also covered is the use of synthetic data generation in energy_py environments.
