computation to help solve the climate problem

Note:

1. it's bad - and worse for poor countries
2. technology is not the only solution - business models, policy, public opinion
3. your personal choices matter

- RL = solve the control problem
- digitization challenge in energy

price response flexible demand 
<br><br>
aka the lazy taxi driver

Note:

- taxi system where government ensures that no one ever waits for a taxi
- supply of taxis == peak demand for taxis
- cost = fixed + variable
- the laziest taxi drivers need to recover their entire fixed + var costs through a few trips
- flexibility solves the problem by letting people wait
- responding to price (not signal from system operator)

---?image=/assets/flex_env.png&size=auto 80%&color=#ffffff

Note:
- state = current + forecast electricity prices, customer demands
- action = flex up, flex down or no-op (discrete)
- reward = cost to supply electricity

details

Note:
- space design is fundamental to the library 
- code that interacts both with agents and environments

---?color=#000000

```python
#  create an action space of two dimensions
action_space = GlobalSpace('action').from_spaces(
    [ContinuousSpace(0, 100), DiscreteSpace(3)],
    ['acceleration', 'gear']
)

#  randomly sample an action
action = action_space.sample()

#  check the action is valid
assert action_space.contains(action)

#  discretize the space
discrete_spaces = action_space.discretize(20)

#  randomly sample a discrete action
action = action_space.sample_discrete()

```
---?color=#000000

```python
#  load a state or observation space from a dataset
state_space = GlobalSpace('state').from_dataset('example')

#Â we can sample an episode from the state
episode = state_space.sample_episode(start=0, end=100)

# sample from the current episode by calling the space
state = state_space(steps=0)
```

**lessons**
<br><br>
simplicity
<br><br>
iterative design

Note:
- two bad implementations don't equal one good one
- solving specific problems here - DQN works because of discretizable action spaces (don't combine high dimensional actions)
- can develop library to take advantage of it
- a master and dev branch
- single inheritance
- use standard library where possible 
- use tensorflow where possible (processors, schedulers etc)

the environment model problem / oppourtunity

Note:
- modern rl so sample inefficient that you need simualtion
but if you have simulation, then there are other better models such as MCTS

- the work in energy is therefore in building useful simulation models - this unlocks both

- Backwards induction = Allows measuring the quality of forecasts (when the model is wrong)

backwards induction

```python

previous_state_payoffs = {state: 0 for state in model.states}

for step in steps[::-1]:
    viable_transitions = [get_viable_transitions(step, next_state, model) for next_state in model.states]
    
    new_state_payoffs = defaultdict(list)
    
    for t in viable_transitions:
        payoff = t.reward + previous_state_payoffs[t.next_state]
        new_state_payoffs[t.state].append(payoff)
        
    for k, v in new_state_payoffs.items():
        new_state_payoffs[k] = np.max(v)
    
    previous_state_payoffs = new_state_payoffs
```

synthetic data - aka poor mans GANS

Note:

- possible to generate synthetic rollouts for time series data (ie demands, prices etc)
- these synthetic rollouts allow testing of performance of the agent on rollouts it's never seen
- generating exact customer profiles is hard - generating believable profiles is easier
